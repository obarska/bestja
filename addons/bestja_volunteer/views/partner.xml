                    Sometimes Odoo links to the "res.partner" form, instead of
                    linking to the "res.users" form (i.e. the user profile) for the
                    related user. For example the "mail" module links to
                    author's / recipient's "partner" form, not their "user" form.
                    Since "users" and "partners" are completely separate models, it
                    is hard to change this behavior without rewriting every view
                    that links to a partner form.
                    That's why we do a client side redirect from partner form to
                    user form using a custom "x2x_redirect" widget. This may not be
                    ideal, but it is way easier than the alternatives.
